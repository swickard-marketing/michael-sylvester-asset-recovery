## Quick Setup Checklist

### 1. Set Up Row 1 Headers

Copy-paste these headers into row 1 of your Google Sheet:

```
VIN	Stock	vehicle_name	Dealer_Name	VDP_URL_1	Main_Photo	Price_Is	Price_Was	Make	Model	Year	Trim	Mileage	certified_pre_owned		Stock_Include	Stock_Exclude		last_updated	Luxury_Subject_Line	Luxury_Preheader	Lifestyle_Subject_Line	Lifestyle_Preheader	Alternative_Luxury_Subject_Line	Alternative_Luxury_Preheader	Alternative_Lifestyle_Subject_Line	Alternative_Lifestyle_Preheader	FollowUp1_Luxury_Subject_Line	FollowUp1_Luxury_Preheader	FollowUp1_Lifestyle_Subject_Line	FollowUp1_Lifestyle_Preheader	FollowUp1_Alternative_Luxury_Subject_Line	FollowUp1_Alternative_Luxury_Preheader	FollowUp1_Alternative_Lifestyle_Subject_Line	FollowUp1_Alternative_Lifestyle_Preheader	FollowUp2_Luxury_Subject_Line	FollowUp2_Luxury_Preheader	FollowUp2_Lifestyle_Subject_Line	FollowUp2_Lifestyle_Preheader	FollowUp2_Alternative_Luxury_Subject_Line	FollowUp2_Alternative_Luxury_Preheader	FollowUp2_Alternative_Lifestyle_Subject_Line	FollowUp2_Alternative_Lifestyle_Preheader
```

**Note:** Columns O and R are empty (reserved). Tab-separated format above.

**Note:** Columns are tab-separated. After pasting, verify alignment.

### 2. Data Flow

- **n8n Workflow writes to:** Columns A-O (vehicle data + timestamp)
- **n8n Workflow reads from:** Columns P-Q (stock filters)
- **Manual entry needed:** Columns P-Q (stock filters) and T-AS (subject lines)
- **Apps Script reads:** Columns A-AS (all data for Customer.io upload)
- **Apps Script uploads:** All vehicle fields + subject lines to Customer.io collections

### 3. Clear Range

The "Clear Google Sheet" node in n8n clears **A2:N** only, preserving:
- Column O (reserved)
- Stock filters (P-Q)
- Column R (reserved)
- last_updated timestamp (S)
- Subject lines (T-AS)

## Column Count Summary

| Range | Count | Purpose | Populated By |
|-------|-------|---------|--------------|
| A-N | 14 | Core vehicle data | n8n workflow |
| O | 1 | Reserved | Future use |
| P-Q | 2 | Stock filters | Manual entry |
| R | 1 | Reserved | Future use |
| S | 1 | last_updated timestamp | Apps Script (on upload) |
| T-AS | 26 | Subject lines & preheaders | Manual entry |
| **Total** | **45** | **Full dataset** | **Mixed** |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Subject lines not uploading to Customer.io

**Solution:** Verify columns T-AS have headers in row 1 and data in rows 2+

### Issue: Stock filters not working

**Solution:** Ensure columns P-Q have headers "Stock_Include" and "Stock_Exclude" in row 1

### Issue: Data misaligned after sync

**Solution:**
1. Check that row 1 headers match exactly as shown above
2. Verify workflow cleared only A2:O (not P-Q or T-AS)
3. Re-import workflow if clear range is incorrect
