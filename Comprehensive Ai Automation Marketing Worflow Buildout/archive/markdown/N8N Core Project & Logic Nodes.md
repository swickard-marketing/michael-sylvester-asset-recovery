# N8N Core Project & Logic Nodes

### N8N Core & Logic Nodes

These nodes form the foundation of any workflow, controlling its execution, logic, and data flow.

Start Node: The default starting point for all manual workflows.

Schedule Node: To trigger workflows on a recurring basis (e.g., daily reports, weekly data syncs). Used for cron jobs mentioned in the plan.

Webhook Node: To receive real-time data from external services and trigger workflows instantly (e.g., new lead from a web form).

IF Node: To create simple two-path conditional logic (e.g., if a lead score is high, send to sales; if not, add to a nurturing sequence).

Switch Node: To create multiple branches based on different conditions, essential for routing data based on source, customer segment, or engagement type.

Merge Node: To combine data from different workflow branches into a single stream for unified processing.

Set Node: To add, modify, or format data fields within the workflow.

Code Node: For custom data manipulation, transformations, and complex logic using JavaScript or Python.

HTTP Request Node: The most critical node for this project, used to connect to any service with a REST API that doesn't have a dedicated n8n node, including the Reynolds Focus CRM custom API.

Execute Command Node: For self-hosted n8n instances, this can run command-line scripts, necessary for browser automation tasks with Playwright or Puppeteer3.

### AI & Data Intelligence Nodes

These nodes are central to the AI-driven analytics, personalization, and decision-making components of the project.

AI Agent Node: The core for creating tool-using agents that can perform actions, reason, and process information.

AWS Bedrock Node: To securely access and use large language models like Anthropic's Claude for content generation, analysis, and humanized messaging.

AI Model Nodes (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.): Direct nodes for interacting with specific LLMs if not routed through Bedrock.

MCP Client Node (Community Node): Essential for interacting with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers allowing n8n to act as a tool within the broader AI ecosystem.

MCP Trigger Node (Community Node): Allows n8n to act as an MCP server, receiving requests from other AI agents or systems.

### Application & Integration Nodes

Marketing & Communication

Customer.io Node: To manage customers, track events, and trigger email/SMS campaigns.

Send Email Node: For sending direct system notifications and reports.

SMS/Call Nodes (e.g., Twilio, ClickSend): To manage outgoing/incoming call automation and SMS messages if not handled by Customer.io. The HTTP Request node can also be used for other providers.

Metricool: No dedicated node exists; use the HTTP Request Node to interact with its API.

Analytics & Reporting

Google Analytics Node: To fetch performance data for websites and campaigns, which feeds into the JOMP system and Power BI reports.

Google Ads Node: To retrieve campaign data, manage audiences, and track ad performance.

Google Tag Manager: GTM is typically managed outside n8n. Data generated by GTM events is captured using the Google Analytics Node.

Power BI: n8n does not have a direct "push to Power BI" node. The standard workflow is to use a database node to send data to a source that Power BI can read.

Microsoft SQL Server Node

PostgreSQL Node

Google Sheets Node (as a simpler alternative)

CRM & Data Management

HTTP Request Node: To integrate with the Reynolds Focus CRM custom API.

FTP Node: To connect to the Max Digital FTP server for inventory management.

Wrike: No dedicated node exists; use the HTTP Request Node to manage tasks and projects via its API.

Website Management

HTTP Request Node: To call an external service or a serverless function that runs Playwright/Puppeteer scripts for DealerOn website automation, as direct browser automation is not a native n8n function.
