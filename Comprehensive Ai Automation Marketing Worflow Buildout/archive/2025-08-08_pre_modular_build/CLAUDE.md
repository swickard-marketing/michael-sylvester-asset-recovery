## Data Integrity Guidelines

- Dont add any data that doesnt physically exist in the customer journey strategy that doesnt exist
- It is essential that you collect the exact data of the node including the node title, a description of the image, the inner content (exactly), and the flow correlation between the data flow elements.

  1. Document the EXACT data of each node including:
    - Node title
    - Description of the image/element
    - The inner content (EXACTLY as visible)
    - The flow correlation between data flow elements
  2. Be thorough in collecting every intricate detail and data flow
  3. Only include what physically exists in the image - don't add any data that
  doesn't exist

- Remember that some robust operations we can host in a script using the N8N code node as well so the length of the flow doesn't have to be so robust
