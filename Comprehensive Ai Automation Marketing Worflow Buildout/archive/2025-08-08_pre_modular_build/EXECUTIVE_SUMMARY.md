# Executive Summary

Over the last week I've been developing the groundwork architecture for the AI-powered Complete Marketing Automation Workflow, establishing the skeletal framework for a five-stage customer journey system. This development consolidates complex workflows from 100+ nodes down to just 4-6 using n8n Code nodes, while integrating Customer.io, Twilio, Metricool, BigQuery, Wrike, DealerOn/Dealer.com, with BannerInSite.com under consideration.

Progress includes extracting the complete journey data flow, building three core workflows (DealerOn integration, Awareness, and Consideration stages), and architecting the JOMP AI integration with Anthropic. Critical components still needed include data mapping, secure credential handling, browser automations, and inference security layers as development continues toward production.
