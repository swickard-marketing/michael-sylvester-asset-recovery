### Documentation Updates

**Setup Guides** - Created step-by-step instructions for implementing the advertising and calling systems.

**Decision Rules** - Defined how the system determines which prospects to prioritize and when to contact them.

## Still Needed to Complete

**Platform Access** - Login credentials for all marketing tools and services.

**Information Flow Setup** - Connecting customer data between different marketing platforms.

**Safety Controls** - Rules to prevent the system from making mistakes or contacting customers too often.

**Website Automation** - Tools to handle repetitive website tasks automatically.

## Remaining Workflows to Build

**Customer Retention** - Keeping in touch with customers after purchase for service and future sales.

**Main Controller** - Central system to coordinate all the different marketing activities.

## Customer Journey Coverage

The system addresses every stage of the customer relationship:

- **Awareness**: Capturing initial interest through digital advertising and web engagement
- **Consideration**: Nurturing prospects with relevant information about vehicles and services
- **Intent**: Responding quickly when prospects show buying signals like scheduling test drives
- **Purchase**: Supporting the sales process with timely follow-ups and appointment management
- **Retention**: Maintaining relationships through service reminders and upgrade opportunities

## Key Benefits When Complete

- Prospects receive immediate responses regardless of time or day
- Consistent messaging across all channels
- Better tracking of what marketing efforts drive actual sales
- Improved customer experience through timely, relevant communications

## Needed for Launch

### Training and Transition Requirements

The marketing team will need comprehensive training on the new system, particularly for managing bulk campaign changes across different brands (Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Toyota). This includes understanding how to update campaigns for dealership events, seasonal promotions, and manufacturer specials. 

### Phased Transition Plan

Current marketing efforts cannot stop during the transition. We'll implement a gradual handover where team members continue their existing processes while learning the new system. This parallel approach ensures no disruption to ongoing campaigns while building confidence in the automation tools.

### Key Training Areas

- **Brand-Specific Campaign Management**: How to adjust messaging and offers for each brand's unique requirements and compliance standards
- **Event and Special Promotion Setup**: Creating and scheduling campaigns for dealership events, holiday sales, and manufacturer incentives
- **Bulk Campaign Operations**: Making system-wide changes efficiently while maintaining brand consistency
- **Performance Monitoring**: Understanding dashboards and reports to track campaign effectiveness
- **Override and Manual Controls**: When and how to intervene in automated processes

### Support During Transition

Our team will provide hands-on support throughout the transition, working alongside marketing staff to ensure smooth adoption. This includes helping with the first several campaign launches, troubleshooting any issues, and refining processes based on real-world usage.

## Next Steps

1. Obtain access credentials for all marketing platforms
2. Complete data field mappings between systems
3. Implement remaining safety controls and approval workflows
4. Begin comprehensive testing with sample customer data
5. Train marketing team on system monitoring and management
